    Fix channel ordering for EEGPT pretrained weights
    
    - Update preprocessing config to properly order channels to match EEGPT's CHANNEL_DICT
    - Select 34 frontal and central electrodes in correct order for pretrained embeddings
    - Add T7 and T8 channels that were previously missing
    - Add learning rate scheduler support (CosineAnnealingLR, StepLR, ReduceLROnPlateau)
    - Enable pretrained checkpoint loading for EEGPT encoder
    - Add comprehensive logging to preprocessing pipeline
    - Reorganize config structure with task-specific configs
    
    This ensures the pretrained chan_embed weights work correctly by maintaining
    the spatial relationships learned during pretraining.

    feat: Add learning rate scheduler and enhance logging
    
    This commit introduces a configurable learning rate scheduler to the training process, allowing for more advanced learning rate control. The scheduler can be configured in `configs/training/default.yaml` and supports `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `StepLR`, and `CosineAnnealingLR`.
    
    Key changes:
    - Added learning rate scheduler to the `Trainer`.
    - Log learning rate to wandb.
    - Added detailed logging to the preprocessing pipeline to provide insights into filtering and transformation steps.
    - Simplified the training configuration in `train.py`.
    - Updated the default configuration to enable preprocessing and per-trial normalization.

    Add EEGPT support and reorganize config structure
    
    Major changes:
    - Integrate EEGPTClassifier model from EEGPT.py
    - Add model selection in train.py (CNN or EEGPT)
    - Reorganize configs into modular subdirectories:
      - configs/model/ for model-specific settings
      - configs/preprocessing/ for preprocessing pipelines
      - configs/training/ for training hyperparameters
    - Update preprocessing to use timepoints instead of ratios for truncation
    - Add case-insensitive electrode name matching in channel selector
    - Create EEGPT config with frontal/central electrode selection
    - Add _self_ to all config defaults to fix Hydra warnings
    - Update all tests to match new preprocessing API
    
    Config structure:
    - Main config.yaml uses Hydra defaults system
    - Modular configs can be mixed and matched
    - EEGPT config uses 32 frontal/central electrodes
    - All task configs updated with proper defaults
